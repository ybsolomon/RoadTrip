# RoadTrip

Design and implement an application for scheduling road trips in the continental USA â€” 48 of the states, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. Assume the user will supply a starting city (San Francisco, for example) and an ending city (eg. Miami). In addition, the user will supply zero, one or more events or places of interest by name, such as the Grand Canyon, Paul Bunyon and Babe the Blue Ox in Minnesota or the Statue of Liberty in New York. Once implemented, your solution must find a route
from the starting city to the ending city in a way that visits each of the events or places of interest while keeping the number of miles driven to a minimum. 

In the example from above, the solution returns a route from San Francisco through the following places, in order:

- Grand Canyon AZ
- Bemidji MN
- New York NY

in that order, finally ending in Miami.

To run this program, input the cities and attractions as requested by the program. The cities and attractions are *case sensitive*.
